<h3> My experience after the project </h3>

This capstone project course gives a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data. 

I learnt about location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. How 
to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world.  
I also learn how to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. I utilized Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which will help you refine your skills for exploring and analyzing data. 

Finally, i used the Folium library to great maps of geospatial data and to communicate my results and findings.
